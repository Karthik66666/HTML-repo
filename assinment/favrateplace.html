             <h3>Bathrinath temple</h3>
             <p>
            Badarinath or Badarinarayana Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu. 
            It is situated in the town of Badrinath in Uttarakhand, India. The temple 
            is also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu-holy shrines for 
            Vaishnavas-who is worshipped as Badrinath. It is open for six months every 
            year (between the end of April and the beginning of November), because of 
            extreme weather conditions in the Himalayan region.

                and historical landmarks rather than palaces specifically. While it doesn't 
                have palaces that are commonly associated with monarchies like Buckingham 
                Palace in the United Kingdom or the Palace of Versailles in France, Norway 
                does have several notable royal residences and historic buildings that hold 
                significance.
